      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Emma grew up playing the clarinet through middle school and high school, so she followed her dream to go to music school for clarinet performance. After receiving a bachelor of music degree in 2019, Emma realized she could not make a living by playing the clarinet. She needed another plan. Luckily, Emma learned she was passionate about coding after taking an intro to computer science class during her undergraduate career. </p>
